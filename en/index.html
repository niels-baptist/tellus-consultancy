                            definition is completely different from that of an accountant. For me it is advising, stimulating and challenging, with the 
                            aim of making the company, or the project, stronger. So my strength lies mainly in my financial background and general knowledge. 
                            I am not a techie or a specialist (unless it is credit finance), but I do help companies optimize their financial planning, in the short and long term.

                                        What is the goal and how do we achieve it? I am also happy to help you with questions about other matters (KYC, hedging,

                </h2>
                <p>After 20 years at KBC Bank, I wanted to focus even more on what I love doing best: giving advice and 
                    helping to make things happen! This both vocally (I just like to give my opinion) numbers (yes, 
                    I am one of those Excel nerds who like to put things into a spreadsheet or, even worse, make a powerpoint of it), as
                    well as  follow up actions!
                    My past as a corporate banker gave me the opportunity to get to know many types of businesses, from 
                    project financing to multinationals, often in the different phases of their 
                    of their existence. Each of these companies and phases has specific needs, whereby customisation and empathy are particularly important.

                        <li><span class="bold underline accentcolour">Starting companies</span> often need to test and refine ideas, moving from an idea to a fundable and feasible plan. 
                            Here, we focus mainly on quantifying and calculating operating costs and investments, in order to lay a solid foundation for further growth.
                            This is both to protect its own invested capital and to provide opportunities to attract external funding.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>I always thought it was great assisting  <span class="bold underline accentcolour">young entrepreneurs</span> and helping them launch projects, especially 
                            because the first investments are the hardest!
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><span class="bold underline accentcolour">Growth companies</span> with their dynamic environment and inexhaustible optimism sometimes also experience growing pains, 
                            whereby it is important not to put the elephant in your mouth all at once, but to eat it bite by bite.
                            <br><br>
                            With these type of companies, it is important to help determine priorities, including whether short-term hyper-growth is sustainable in the long term. 
                            This is both for the shareholders (increase or dilute?) as well as the external financing parties (can they or do they want to follow?). 
                            Both towards risks taken (every risk has its price, but is the price justified?) and the new opportunities at hand.

                        <li><span class="bold underline accentcolour">Mature companies</span> do they exist? In theory, yes, but every company knows better than to take it easy! 
                            If not, the decline has probably already begun. It is therefore a question of building on and protecting what is good and making plans to embark on a new growth plan.
                            This can be done organically through own development (within or outside the company), or by skipping the start-up phase through an
                            <span class="bold underline accentcolour">acquisition</span>. Especially when it comes to reinventing themselves, companies need support, for sure when it comes to
                            takeovers. The bride of course dresses as beautifully as possible, her parents (bankers, consultants) will
                            especially highlight the good qualities (several layers even!), but it comes down to determining the right
                            dowry. You don't want to deal with the winner's curse! And this is where an independent advisor can help you a lot!

                        <li>For me, it was always fun to challenge these kinds of companies and help strengthen their plans! 
                                Sometimes that means building in safeguards and pointing out unforeseen risks. But always focused on 
                                the end goal and grafted onto the identity of the company.
